.TH ANIC "1" "January 2010" "ANI Toolchain" "ANI"
.SH NAME
\fBanic\fR \- ANI programming language compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anic
\fIsourceFile\fR... [-] [-o \fIoutputFile\fR] [-p \fIoptimizationLevel\fR] [-s] [-v] [-e] [-h]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Compile, assemble, and link ANI programs into standalone binaries.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\fR
read standard input as if it were a source file
.TP
\fB\-o\fR
specify the path to output the resulting binary to
.IP
If this option is not specified, the default is \fBa.out\fR.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR
specify the level of code optimization applied during compilation
.IP
The valid range is \fB0\fR to \fB3\fR inclusive, with larger numbers specifying increasingly more powerful (but also time-consuming) optimizations.
If this option is not specified, the default is \fB1\fR.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
silent mode; print nothing, not even compilation errors
.IP
Cannot be used with \fB\-v\fR.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
verbose mode; print additional information about the compilation process on the standard output
.IP
Cannot be used with \fB\-s\fR.
The additional information includes lexical tokens, parsing transitions, symbol trees, typing information, and resource allocation.
.IP
It is highly recommended to pipe the output of this option to a file or stream viewer, as it can be quite lengthy, even for small source programs.
.IP
For example,
.IP
\fBanic program.ani \-v | less\fR
.IP
will make viewing the verbose ouput much more manageable.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR
pedantic error mode; do not to give up on compilation even when encountering confusing or large volumes of errors
.IP
Cannot be used with \fB\-s\fR.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
program help; display this manual page
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fBanic program.ani\fR
Compile, assemble, and link the ANI program in source file \fIprogram.ani\fR and output the resulting binary as \fIa.out\fR.
.TP
\fBanic program.ani \-o program\fR
Compile, assemble, and link the ANI program in source file \fIprogram.ani\fR and output the resulting binary as \fIprogram\fR.
.TP
\fBanic \- \-o program\fR
Same as above, except read program source from standard input.
.TP
\fBanic program.ani \-v\fR
Compile \fIprogram.ani\fR to \fIa.out\fR and additionally dump verbose compilation details to standard output.
.TP
\fBanic program.ani \-p 3 \-e \-o program\fR
Compile \fIprogram.ani\fR to \fIprogram\fR using level 3 optimizations and no limits on the amount of errors printed.
